## Progress since last meeting
- Making progress with FSCA in python

## Disscussed
- Feedback on preliminary report. The university has recognised that due to exceptional circumstances, the submitted prelimary report was not up to standard and have allowed for a resubmission. Arranged a resubmission deadline of 8th January - to be emailed to Sean when completed.
- Points to take into consideration during the rewrite of the prelimary report:
  - Inconsistencies with references
  - A few typos to fix
  - One of the referenced papers discussed submodularity in a completely different subjext that what I am focusing so is irrelevant to the project
  - There was some confusion around optimization techniques ___i.e. lazy greedy and stochastic greedy___ - make sure this is sorted in the rewrite.


## Decisions arrived at during meeting
- Continue with implementation of the FSCA algorithm.
- Stick to project plan, time boxing activities to manage progress.
