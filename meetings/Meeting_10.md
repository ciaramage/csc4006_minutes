## Progress since last meeting
- Plan how initial results should be visualised
- Created methods to save and load sample datasets for testing the algorithms

## Disscussed
- My laptop is very slow and affecting the performance of the algorithms
- Maximising the Rayleigh Quotient in FSCA seems to behaving different to what is expected - difficult to tell with the machine's technical difficulties.
- Creating a function to save numpy 2D arrays to a CSV file to make it easier for Sean to repeat functions like FSCA on MatLab and compare results.


## Decisions arrived at during meeting
- Figure out why the machine is having technical difficulties
- Create a function to save numpy 2D arrays to a CSV file
- Keep working on tasks and timeboxing to stay on track
