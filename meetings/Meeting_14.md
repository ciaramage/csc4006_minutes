## Progress since last meeting
- Created plan and overview for submission documents


## Disscussed
- Went through plan and submission overview
- Talked about the demo and how to present the research. It's not just a presentation on the code but rather the research paper.
- Showed the apricot package to Sean. Apricot is a python package for the submodular optimization of feature selection methods. It is very similar to what I am doing except the functions I am using are not submodular.
- Talked about how acceptance of exceptional circumstances effects my plan.

## Decisions arrived at during meeting
- Email Sean with links to the Apricot package on github and it's documentation.
- Stick to the plan and timebox activities.
