## Progress since last meeting
- Lazy greedy optimization complete for FSCA and UFS
- Started working on stochastic greedy optimization for FSCA, OPFS, and UFS
  
## Disscussed
- Methods for sampling data - either with replacement or without replacement
- Each component selected in the stochastic optimisations is selected from a different subset of the original data. Talked about how already selected components should be used to orthogonalise or deflate the next subset.
- Finalised how this works my implementation of stochastic greedy FSCA and ensured that the mathematical basis behind it is correct.

## Decisions arrived at during meeting
- This will be the final formal meeting of the project
- Complete the writeup of the research article and the software development report.
- The demo presentation video will be made after the reports are submitted
- To used the stochastic greedy optimization process implemented for FSCA, in the OPFS and UFS algorithms.
