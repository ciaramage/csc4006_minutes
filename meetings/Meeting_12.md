## Progress since last meeting
- New laptop was delivered, setup and was in use for a week. The display stopped working so was sent back. Had to switch to the house Desktop again.

## Disscussed
- Email Sean to request Pitprops and Wave Sites datasets via email
- Went through UFS paper to help explain some of my confusion around some of the algorithm steps.

## Decisions arrived at during meeting
- Decided that I will leave out the step that rejects columns whose minimum coefficient is greater than the provided maximum coefficient of determination. This step could easily be included if necessary down the line.
- Keep sticking to project plan, time boxing activities to manage progress.
